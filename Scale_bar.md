     # Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a non-parametric test for paired oridnal data)
        #Assumptions:
          #1. Dependent samples - the two samples need to be dependent observations           of the cases. 
          #2. Independence - The Wilcoxon sign test assumes independence, meaning             that the paired observations are randomly and independently drawn.
          #3. Continuous dependent variable - To account for the fact that in most              cases the dependent variable is binominal distributed, a continuity               correction is applied.
          #4. Ordinal level of measurement - The Wilcoxon sign test needs both                  dependent measurements to be at least of ordinal scale.
