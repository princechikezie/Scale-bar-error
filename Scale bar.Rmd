 # Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a non-parametric test for paired oridnal data)
    #Assumptions:
      #1. Dependent samples - the two samples need to be dependent observations           of the cases. 
      #2. Independence - The Wilcoxon sign test assumes independence, meaning             that the paired observations are randomly and independently drawn.
      #3. Continuous dependent variable - To account for the fact that in most              cases the dependent variable is binominal distributed, a continuity               correction is applied.
      #4. Ordinal level of measurement - The Wilcoxon sign test needs both                  dependent measurements to be at least of ordinal scale.

#Null Hypothesis: The coefficients associated with the variables is equal to zero. 
#Alternate hypothesis: The coefficients are not equal to zero (i.e. there exists a relationship between the independent variable in question and the dependent variable).  

# Assumptions: 

# There is a linear trend between x and y.
# The observations in the sample are independent.
# x is measured without error.
# The residuals are normally distributed .
# The residuals have the same variance for all fitted values of y

#Regression coefficients:
#Intercept = -0.36, t(13) = -2.93, p-value < 0.05
#Distance_cm = -1.33, t(13) = 0.-41.09, p-value < 0.001

#Interpretation:
  #As the p-value for regression coefficients Intercept (p-value < 0.001) & interest_rate (p-value ) we reject the null hypothesis, thus the coefficients are not equal to zero (i.e. there exists a relationship between the independent variable in question and the dependent variable).  


# Correlation assesses the linear association or strength of relationship between two variables.

#Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation: 

# H0: There is no signifiant association between the two variables.
# H1: There is a significant association between the two variables.

# Assumptions:
#Variables measured on an ordinal or interval or ratio scale
#There is a monotonic relationship between the variables

# As p-value < 0.001, we reject H0, thus there is significant association between the two variables
