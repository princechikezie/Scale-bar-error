 # Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a non-parametric test for paired oridnal data)
    #Assumptions:
      #1. Dependent samples - the two samples need to be dependent observations           of the cases. 
      #2. Independence - The Wilcoxon sign test assumes independence, meaning             that the paired observations are randomly and independently drawn.
      #3. Continuous dependent variable - To account for the fact that in most              cases the dependent variable is binominal distributed, a continuity               correction is applied.
      #4. Ordinal level of measurement - The Wilcoxon sign test needs both                  dependent measurements to be at least of ordinal scale. 

# H0:  median difference between observed & reality is zero
# H1: median difference between observed & reality is not equal to zero
